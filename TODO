better fbtst program!

Update doc/* for event functions

Improved wrappers for bitblt.

resolution selection code: need some way for users to select a resolution,
independent of hardware. Such as a picture viewer wanting 640x480x256, if
that is not available perhaps it could be offered the 'nearest' modes, for
example 320x480x256 or 640x480x16 depending on whether it wanted resolution
or colours. Comments please to the list.

HAM8 and HAM6 support.

Interleaved planes for OCS/ECS.

filled rectangles/polylines/polygons/textblt

And lots of other things I'm sure you can see 8-)
