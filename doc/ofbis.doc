Framebuffer Library Programming Reference
=========================================

N.B. Tabsize for this and all ofbis files is 8, like linux.

A minimal framebuffer program would have something like:

	{
		FB *f;

		f = FBopen( NULL, FB_OPEN_NEW_VC );
		...
		/* draw/do things here */
		...
		FBclose( f );
	}

Library startup/exit
====================

FB *FBopen( const char *fbname, unsigned short opts )
-----------------------------------------------------

FBopen is used to initialise the framebuffer library.

fbname is the filename of the framebuffer to open (eg "/dev/fb1vga16") or it
can be left as NULL to use either the value of the FRAMEBUFFER environment
variable (if it is set) or if it is not, the current framebuffer device.
opts is a series of options that must be ORed
together if you select multiple options.

Current options are:

FB_KEEP_CURRENT_VC: The current console will be used for display.
FB_OPEN_NEW_VC: The first available console will be opened and switched to for
		display.
The above two options are mutually exclusive.

It returns a handle for the opened framebuffer.

void FBclose( FB *f )
---------------------

FBclose shuts the framebuffer f, and if FB_OPEN_NEW_VC was selected when f was
opened, switches to the console that was current when FBopen was called.

Graphics functions
==================

void FBputpixel( FB *f, unsigned short x, unsigned short y, unsigned long col )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FBputpixel draws a single point at (x,y) on framebuffer f, with colour col.

unsigned long FBgetpixel( FB *f, unsigned short x, unsigned short y )
---------------------------------------------------------------------

FBgetpixel returns the colour value at the point (x,y) on framebuffer f.

void FBhline( FB *f, unsigned short x1, unsigned short x2, unsigned short y,
		unsigned long col )
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FBhline draws a horizontal line on framebuffer f from (x1,y) to (x2,y) with
colour col.

void FBline( FB *f, unsigned short x1, unsigned short y1, unsigned short x2,
		unsigned short y2, unsigned long col )
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FBline draws a line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) on framebuffer f with colour col.

void FBbitblt( FB *f, FBBLTPBLK *fbb)
-------------------------------------

FBbitblt blits a rectangular block from one memory area to another. It is
not limited to the framebuffer area.

void FBputchar( FB *f, unsigned short x, unsigned short y, unsigned long fgcol, 
		unsigned long bgcol, unsigned char ch )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FBputchar puts one character, ch, at (x,y) with colour fgcol. bgcol is
currently unused, and might be removed in a later version!

Colourmap functions
===================

FBCMAP *FBgetcmap( FB *f )
--------------------------

FBgetcmap returns a new FBCMAP structure with the current colourmap of the
framebuffer f. It may be overwritten with a new colourmap for setting with the
FBputcmap function. Use FBfreecmap to free the colourmap allocated with this
function.

void FBputcmap( FB *f, FBCMAP *fbcmap )
---------------------------------------

FBputcmap installs the colourmap fbcmap on the framebuffer f. No error checking
of the members of fbcmap is done. To set a single colour or a range of colours,
set the start, end and len members of fbcmap appropriately.

void FBfreecmap( FBCMAP *fbcmap )
---------------------------------

FBfreecmap frees the fbcmap allocated with FBgetcmap.

Screen settings functions (likely to be made private)
=====================================================

void FBgetfix( FB *f )
void FBgetvar( FB *f )
void FBputvar( FB *f )

These all correspond directly to the fixed and variable structures used with the
linux framebuffer. Mainly used to simplify things at this early stage.

Debug functions (likely to be made private)
===========================================

void FBfinfdump( FB *f )
void FBvinfdump( FB *f )
void FBcmapdump( FB *f )

For library programming only. You can work them out. 8-)
