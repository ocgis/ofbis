* Before compiling, be sure that you use 2.1.x kernel include files. The
* library still works, at least for me, with 2.0.x kernels, but needs 2.1.x 
* include files to compile. - Tomas Berndtsson

Just type "./configure" from the main directory, and "make" to compile 
the library. That's it. "make install" will install the libraries and
include files. Default install directory is /usr/local/lib/ and
/usr/local/include/fb/.

Internal library memory leak checking can be enabled/disabled by the #define 
in fballoc.h. At the moment it is set on.

Please see doc/ofbis.doc for a programming reference.

Please see DESIGN before adding/changing anything in this library.
