* Before compiling, be sure that you use 2.1.x kernel include files. The
* library still works, at least for me, with 2.0.x kernels, but needs 2.1.x 
* include files to compile. - Tomas Berndtsson

Just type "make" from the main directory, and that's it. "make install" is
not well made, but works.
If you are developing this, type "make dep" before you type make for complete
dependencies.

Internal library memory leak checking can be enabled/disabled by the #define in
fballoc.h. At the moment it is set on.

Please see doc/ofbis.doc for a programming reference.

Please see DESIGN before adding/changing anything in this library.
